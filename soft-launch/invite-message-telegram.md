# Soft Launch Invite — Telegram Version

## Message (English — for UK/international friends)

Hey! 👋

I've been building something and I'd love your honest feedback before we launch publicly.

**Evolving Home** (evolvinghome.ai) is a free tool that shows you the energy story of any UK home — your rating, how much you're overpaying, what grants you qualify for, and what upgrades actually make sense.

Just type a UK postcode (try **AL1 4QA** if you don't have one handy) and see what comes up.

Takes 30 seconds to try. Then if you have 2 minutes, drop your thoughts here:
👉 **evolvinghome.ai/feedback**

No signup needed. Just brutal honesty appreciated 🙏

היי! 👋

בניתי כלי חדש ואשמח לשמוע מה אתה/את חושב/ת לפני שאנחנו משיקים.

**Evolving Home** (evolvinghome.ai) — כלי חינמי שמראה לך את סיפור האנרגיה של כל בית בבריטניה. הדירוג שלך, כמה אתה משלם מדי, אילו מענקים מגיעים לך, ואילו שדרוגים שווים את זה.

פשוט תכניס מיקוד בריטי (נסה **AL1 4QA** אם אין לך) ותראה מה יוצא.

30 שניות לנסות. אחר כך אם יש לך 2 דקות, תשאיר פידבק כאן:
👉 **evolvinghome.ai/feedback**

לא צריך הרשמה. רק כנות 🙏

## Email Version (more detailed, for friends less active on Telegram)

**Subject:** Quick favor — 2 min feedback on my new project?

Hey [Name],

I've been working on a side project called **Evolving Home** and we're getting close to launching. Before we do, I'd really value your honest take.

**What it does:** Enter any UK postcode and instantly see your home's energy rating, how much you could save per year, which government grants you qualify for (some are up to £38K!), and what upgrades make the most financial sense.

**Try it:** https://evolvinghome.ai
(Use postcode **AL1 4QA** for a great demo if you don't have a UK one)

**Leave feedback:** https://evolvinghome.ai/feedback
(Quick form — takes 2 minutes, no signup needed)

I'm especially curious about:
- First impression — does it make sense?
- Would you actually use this if you owned a UK home?
- Anything confusing or broken?

Thanks so much 🙏
Eran
