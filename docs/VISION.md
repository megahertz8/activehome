# Evolving Home

**Built once. Evolving forever.**

## The Home Is the User

A home outlives every person who lives in it. A Victorian terrace built in 1890 has had six families, two world wars, and three energy crises. It's still standing. Its owners came and went. The home endured.

Yet we treat homes like they're frozen in time. An EPC is a snapshot — a Polaroid taken once a decade, shoved in a drawer, forgotten. It tells you what a home was, not what it could become.

Evolving Home changes that.

**Every home gets a permanent energy biography.** A living record that begins the day it's built and never ends. Every improvement writes a new chapter. Every owner is a guardian — temporary custodian of something that will outlast them.

When you buy a home, you inherit its full story. When you sell, the next owner picks up where you left off. The home's evolution is continuous. You're just its current chapter.

*Be your home's best chapter.*

## What This Actually Means

### A Living Score, Not a Dead Certificate

Your home's score isn't a letter on a piece of paper. It's a number from 0-100 that moves:

- Energy prices shift → your savings potential changes overnight
- A new grant launches → a measure you couldn't afford is suddenly free
- Heat pump costs drop 12% → your payback shrinks from 5 years to 4
- You insulate your loft → your score jumps, your ranking rises
- Winter approaches → your heating forecast updates, your prep plan refreshes

An EPC is a photograph. Your Evolving Home score is a heartbeat.

### The Home Remembers Everything

Every improvement is logged. Not by you filling in forms — by the system learning:

- What was done (cavity wall insulation, 2026)
- What it cost (£1,500, fully covered by GBIS)
- What it saved (verified by smart meter: 22% heating reduction)
- What comes next (heat pump is now viable — fabric's good enough)

This isn't a to-do list. It's an institutional memory for your home. The kind of knowledge that normally lives in one person's head and disappears when they move.

### Fabric First, Always

We won't let you waste money. If your walls leak heat like a sieve, we'll tell you to insulate before buying a £12,000 heat pump. Every other tool sells you the expensive thing. We sell you the right thing, in the right order.

This earns trust. Trust keeps people coming back.

## Why Homes Evolve

A home from 1960 wasn't built wrong — it was built for 1960. Insulation standards didn't exist. Double glazing was a luxury. Heat pumps were science fiction.

But 1960 was 66 years ago. The technology moved on. The climate moved on. Energy prices moved on. The home stayed still.

That's the gap. Not bad homes — **stuck homes**. 29 million UK homes, 80% rated D or below. Not because they can't improve, but because nobody showed them the path.

Evolving Home is the path.

**The climate changes. So should your home.**

## The Flywheel

This is where it gets powerful.

Every home that improves teaches us something. A Victorian terrace in Bristol that installed external wall insulation generates real data — what it cost, what it saved, what went wrong, what went right.

That data (anonymised, aggregated, privacy-preserving) makes our recommendations better for every OTHER Victorian terrace in the country. And every semi-detached. And every 1960s bungalow.

**Federated Learning** makes this work at scale:
- Models train on local data — nothing raw ever leaves your home
- Only learnings are shared, never personal information  
- Regional patterns emerge naturally (damp in the West Country, wind in Scotland, solar in the South East)
- Real costs replace estimates. Real savings replace assumptions.

The more homes evolve, the smarter the system gets. The smarter the system gets, the more homes evolve.

This flywheel is the moat. It compounds. Every day the system gets better. Every day it gets harder to replicate.

## Energy Leagues

People don't check their EPC twice. They check their ranking weekly.

Your home competes against similar homes — not unfairly (a flat doesn't compete with a detached), but meaningfully:

- **Street League** — where does your home sit on your street?
- **Type League** — how does your 1930s semi compare to other 1930s semis?
- **Area League** — your postcode district ranking
- **National League** — top percentile across the UK

Tiers: Foundation → Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum → Vanguard

When you improve, you rise. When neighbours improve, you feel it. Seasonal challenges ("Winter Ready: insulate before October, earn Gold") create urgency without guilt.

But it's not just competition. It's community.

"Sarah, 3 doors down, got her cavity walls done for free through GBIS. Here's how."

Neighbours helping neighbours. Real improvements, shared openly. A street that improves together becomes a better place to live — and the house prices show it.

## The Moments That Matter

The relationship stays alive through timely, relevant nudges — not spam:

🔔 *"New BUS grant launched — your home qualifies for £7,500 off a heat pump"*

📉 *"Heat pump prices dropped 12% since you last checked. Your payback is now 4.2 years"*

🏘️ *"3 homes on your street improved this month. You dropped to #8"*

🌡️ *"October forecast: your heating bill will spike. Here's your 3-step winter prep"*

🆕 *"New insulation material just arrived in the UK — here's what it means for your walls"*

📊 *"Your smart meter shows 15% more usage than predicted. Possible draught issue?"*

Every notification is a reason to come back. Every return is a chance to improve. Every improvement feeds the flywheel.

## What Changes When Every Home Has a Biography

**When you buy a home** — you see its full evolution. Not a stale EPC from 2019. A living history with verified improvements, measured savings, and a clear roadmap of what's next. "This home improved 44 points in 3 years. The previous owner insulated and added solar. A heat pump is the logical next step."

**When you sell a home** — your improvements have documented, verified value. Smart meter data proves the savings are real. That's worth thousands on the listing price.

**When you insure a home** — a documented, improving home is a lower-risk home. Better premiums, fewer claims.

**When you mortgage a home** — lenders see a trajectory. A home that's actively improving is a better asset. Green mortgage rates follow.

**When you govern a region** — councils see which streets need help, which areas are improving, where grants are working and where they're not. Policy decisions backed by real data, not surveys.

Like a credit score — but for your home's energy performance. One you can actively improve. One that outlives you.

## The Standard

In five years, "What's your Evolving Home score?" should be as natural as "What's your credit score?"

Every home has a story. Most of them are stuck on the same page. We give them the pen.

A home is never finished. It's always evolving.
