## AI-Powered Insights

### Core Features
- **Personalized Energy Assessments**: Scan home → instant energy rating + renovation roadmap
- **Solar Potential Analysis**: Roof analysis + payback calculations
- **Grant Matching**: Auto-match to available incentives (Boiler Upgrade Scheme, MaPrimeRénov')
- **Contractor Network**: Affiliate links to verified local professionals

### Federated Learning Architecture
**Privacy-First Global Model Improvement**

Evolving Home leverages federated learning (FL) to continuously improve AI models without compromising user privacy:

- **Local Training**: Models train on-device using user scan data (building characteristics, energy patterns)
- **Encrypted Updates**: Only aggregated, anonymized model updates are shared
- **Regional Aggregation**: Updates collected in regional servers for privacy compliance
- **Global Model Enhancement**: Aggregated improvements benefit all users worldwide

**Data Points for FL:**
- Building characteristics (age, size, insulation, heating type)
- Energy consumption patterns and seasonal variations
- Scan aggregates and user feedback loops
- Renovation success metrics and energy savings achieved

**Benefits:**
- More accurate recommendations through collective intelligence
- Localized model adaptation without data sharing
- GDPR/CCPA compliant privacy preservation
- Continuous improvement without centralized data collection

### Technical Architecture
- **App-Cloud Split**: Heavy computation on-device, cloud for aggregation/sync
- **Cross-Platform**: iOS Core ML, Web TensorFlow.js, Android ML Kit
- **Edge Computing**: Per-scan server spin-up for processing efficiency
- **Open-Source Strategy**: Core FL algorithms MIT-licensed, monetizable features proprietary

## Market Opportunity
- **Global Home Renovation Market**: $500B+ annually
- **Energy Efficiency Focus**: EU Green Deal, US Inflation Reduction Act
- **AI Disruption**: Democratizing expert-level analysis for homeowners

## Roadmap Phases
1. **Foundation** (Current): UK EPC integration, basic AI recommendations
2. **Expansion** (2025): Multi-country support, solar analysis, FL integration
3. **Scale** (2026): Contractor marketplace, advanced analytics, global adoption
